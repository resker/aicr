### Features

- Add aws-efa component  by [@Kevin-Hawkins](https://github.com/Kevin-Hawkins)
- Fix and improve ConfigMap and CR deployment  by [@yuanchen8911](https://github.com/yuanchen8911)
- Skyhook, split customizations to their own component and add training  by [@ayuskauskas](https://github.com/ayuskauskas)
- Add skeleton multi-phase validation framework  by [@xdu31](https://github.com/xdu31)
- Custom resources must explicity set their helm hooks OR opt out  by [@ayuskauskas](https://github.com/ayuskauskas)
- Enhance validate command with multi-phase and agent support  by [@mchmarny](https://github.com/mchmarny)

### Other

- Fix skyhook deployment: post-install approach for CRD-dependent resources

The Skyhook CR (customization-ubuntu.yaml) depends on the Skyhook CRD
which is installed by the skyhook-operator subchart. Helm validates ALL
manifests before installing ANY resources, so the CR fails validation
when placed in templates/ because the CRD doesn't exist yet.

Changes:
1. Move manifests from templates/ to post-install/ directory
2. Process Helm template syntax to plain YAML for kubectl apply
3. Add post-install step to deployment instructions
4. Fix customization-ubuntu.yaml: add required image and version fields

The deployment flow is now:
1. helm install - installs all subcharts including skyhook-operator (with CRD)
2. kubectl apply -f post-install/ - applies CRD-dependent resources

This approach ensures CRDs exist before their dependent resources are applied.
